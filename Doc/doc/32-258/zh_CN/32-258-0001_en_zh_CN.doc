<p>　　During the Declining Age of the Dharma, there is no way to attain Buddhahood except by reciting "Amitabha". 
<p>　　Just think it through, you will realize how hard it is to sever yourself from desires. 
<p>　　Reciting "Amitabha" is the only way that enables people to attain Buddhahood by going to Amitabha's Pure Land after death so long they succeed in suppressing their desires. 
<p>　　Without that way, we will not be able to make it. 
<p>　　You have got to weigh the pros and cons carefully, If you cannot sever yourselves from all desires, then you should take the easier way by reciting "Amitabha" wholeheartedly. 
<p>　　This will definitely set you on the course to success. 
<p>　　So, if you can sever yourselves from all your desires, fine. 
<p>　　But if you cannot do that, then following any other way will be a dangerous course, full of pitfalls for you to fall into, and you will not succeed attaining Buddhahood. 
<p>　　We must understand well that only this way can save the sentient beings of the Age of Declining Dharma. 
<p>　　Devoted to taking this approach by practising and introducing to others the recitation of "Amitabha", you will then succeed one day. 
<p>　　To be a person is to learn to be humble. 
<p>　　If you learn to respect others, then you will succeed. 
<p>　　As the saying goes, "As you respect others, they will also respect you". 
<p>　　Being arrogant is the worst. 
<p>　　Once you are full of yourself, you are finished, you have no future. 
<p>　　You must learn to be humble no matter how great you are. 
<p>　　Why? 
<p>　　Because all sentient beings and the Buddhas are one, they are equal, there is no difference. 
<p>　　There is no difference. 
<p>　　If you insist on differentiating, then you are wrong. 
<p>　　Being equal is to teach you to be humble and to respect others. 
<p>　　This is real equality. 
<p>　　It does not manifest itself in arrogance. 
<p>　　Every Buddha, every Bodhisattva, is humility itself. 
<p>　　I often talk about humility. 
<p>　　As Professor Thome H. Fang put it, "Studying Buddhism is the greatest pleasure in life". 
<p>　　Have you experienced the greatest pleasure in life? 
<p>　　I have. 
<p>　　That is why I believe what he said. 
<p>　　What is the greatest pleasure? 
<p>　　Be humble and respect others, that is the greatest pleasure. 
<p>　　Praise others to the sky and bring yourself down, that is the greatest happiness, the greatest pleasure. 
<p>　　Buddha respects others. 
<p>　　Buddha Amitabha praises all other Buddhas. 
<p>　　Definitely, those who are arrogant, those who sing their own praises, and those who destroy others will never attain peace and happiness. 
<p>　　The Bible of Christianity also promotes humility. 
<p>　　If you can achieve hating no one in your life, then you are almost there; but if you still have enemy or foe, or people you dislike or people you are unhappy with, then you are rather far away from your goal. 
<p>　　Where should we start learning to become a Buddha? 
<p>　　By letting go. 
<p>　　What should we let go of? 
<p>　　Letting go of your arrogance, letting go of your many bad habits. 
<p>　　Start from right here, so you won't be wasting your efforts. 
<p>　　Learn to be humble and to respect others, and you will find real happiness and spiritual joy.　　</html>
