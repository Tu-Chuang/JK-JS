<p>　　When we learned Buddhism, Mr. Lee said that we couldn’t lecture in public until we were 40 years old. He worried that we were too young to keep the precepts.
<p>　　This happens a lot. Some people can lecture in Academy of Buddhism because the temptation they face is limited. However, they must be more than 40 years old to lecture in public. Nowadays, even people above 40 years old are incapable of lecturing in public. What Mr. Lee said is based on his experience. If you don’t follow, you will have troubles, which then destroy your future. The desires for wealth, sexual love, fame, food and drink, and sleep are horrifying because they lead to Hell.　　I don’t want fame, and I don’t want power. My greatest pleasure in life is what Professor Fang Dongmei taught me “Learning Buddhism is the greatest pleasure in the life”. You understand, don’t you? What is greatest pleasure? The greatest pleasure is to not manage people, money, and things. I did it, so I am very happy. I don’t hate or make enemy with anyone in my life. I only lecture. Depending on my physical condition, I can lecture one hour per day when I am well. If I am not well, I lecture once per week. Mr. Lee had lectured once per week for 38 years in Taichung. You must understand this. The greatest pleasure is to be free and unoccupied. 　　Currently, I am helping every religion in the world to train successors, to help them train religion instructors.　　We must keep in mind that we shouldn’t learn Buddhism in the wrong ways that lead to Hell. The door to Hell is just next to the one to Buddhism. If you open the wrong door, you will fall into Hell. That is horrifying! Following 5 Precepts and practicing 10 Virtues, you will not fall into Hell.　　When Pure Land Association was established in the U.S, we proposed 5 subjects, which is to follow precepts.
<p>　　The first clause of Three Blessings of the Pure Land Doctrine: to show filial piety to parents, follow teachers’ instructions, be merciful and avoid killing, and practice 10 Virtues. To respect and follow teachers’ instructions is very important. We must carry out this.
