<p>　　Protectors of Buddhism should have wisdom and blessings. Without wisdom and blessings, protectors will do more harm than good to Buddhism. This is something that we must realise. The rise or decline of Buddhism and religions both depend on next 10 years. In next 10 years, if they rise, they will thrive; if they cannot rise, they will certainly decline, so these are critical years.
<p>　　It is time for you to accumulate virtues. It is also time for you to commit evil deeds. It requires full attention no matter for lay practitioners or Buddhist monks. If you commit wrongful deeds, you will fall into Hell. If you follow the right way to support Buddhism, you can attain rebirth in Pure Land at your own wish with Buddha’s support. This is the key moment. 　　It is an admirable opportunity for me to meet Mrs. Han. She was truly active in supporting and protecting Buddhism, without the intention to obtain personal fame or private profits. What a rarest and most valuable example that she set for us all! All the Buddhism followers should clearly identify real protectors of Buddhism. It is very hard to find those who can promote or protect Buddhism. We must tell them clearly.　　People of our generation don’t have self-discipline. Instead of really thinking for Buddhism and right belief, they all value personal fame and profit. This is serious sin. This is serious sin no matter for lay practitioners (protectors of Buddhism) or Buddhist monks (promoters of Buddhism). They will know after they die, but it will be too late.　　To accumulate virtue is the first merit in Buddhism. If you follow the instructions correctly, you are accumulating blessings and saving Buddhism. If you pursue personal fame and profits, you will fall into Hell. You will never know the truth until you fall into Hell. This is too torturing and unworthy to try.　　How to accumulate blessings? No one knows. Everyone knows. Everyone doesn’t know. By reciting “Amitabha”. What is the greatest blessing? Reciting “Amitabha” to attain rebirth in Amitabha’s Pure Land is the greatest blessing. So I say everyone knows and doesn’t know. They know when they learn the truth, but they don’t if no one tells them. 　　It is good to bear some hardship in this mundane world because it eliminates your sins. You shouldn’t think that you are insulted, bullied, cheated, or harmed. Instead, you need to see them as good things because they help eliminate your sins. If you don’t appreciate and make enemies of them, you will never know when your sins can be eliminated. It is blessing when your mind remains pure, but it is sin if your mind is stirred by desires and afflictions. Does your mind generate afflictions, happiness, or the intention to recite “Amitabha” more every day? To stir your mind by these wandering thoughts is all committing sin.　　</html>
