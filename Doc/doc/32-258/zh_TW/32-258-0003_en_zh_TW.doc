<p>　　No one believes in what religions can offer.
<p>　　In the future quantum theory will greatly help the unity of religions: "All gods are one entity, all religions are one family."  
<p>　　Quantum theory will prove this scientifically. 
<p>　　Your pure mind attained is the Buddha's mind, which is omnipotent and all-knowing.
<p>　　Why?
<p>　　Because everything comes from your mind. 
<p>　　If you use your pure mind, then you will know everything. 
<p>　　This is not strange at all.
<p>　　Everyone is capable of being supernatural because it is instinct. 
<p>　　Where has your supernatural power gone? 
<p>　　It got lost. 
<p>　　You lost it the moment you started thinking.
<p>　　Observing precepts helps meditation.  
<p>　　Meditation brings on wisdom. 
<p>　　Wisdom is instinct. 
<p>　　That is how not thinking leads to wisdom.
<p>　　That is how we get to know everything, just as the Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas do.
<p>　　They know because they are not lost. 
<p>　　We don't know because we are lost.
<p>　　What is getting lost? 
<p>　　Thinking is getting lost.
<p>　　When we see fruits on the table, it is awareness that enables us to see them. 
<p>　　Once we start thinking about wanting to eat them, we are lost.
<p>　　It takes great skills to eat them without thinking about them. 
<p>　　So by practising meditation, wisdom will come naturally.
<p>　　Orientals emphasise mental tranquility, that state of the mind is the "pure mind". 
<p>　　This is the core of learning.
<p>　　Once your mind is stirred, you are lost. 
<p>　　When it comes to the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind reacting to sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and idea, the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are different from us. 
<p>　　Their mind is in a quiet state and they do not think even when they use their eyes to see and their ears to hear.  
<p>　　When the eyes achieve samadhi on seeing and the ears achieve samadhi on hearing, the pure mind will appear.  
<p>　　The Buddhas and the Bodhisattvas can do it, so can each of us.
<p>　　So everything originates from the same entity. 
<p>　　The whole universe and each of us are one entity.
<p>　　To practise Buddhism is to return to the same entity. 
<p>　　To return to the same entity offers us the ultimate freedom from our being.
<p>　　How to tell whether it is true or false? 
<p>　　As quantum theory puts it, everything from a mind stirred is false. 
<p>　　With the whole universe in front of me, it is false once my mind is stirred and I start thinking. 
<p>　　It is true once I keep my mind in a quiet state and do not think.
<p>　　Trueness and falseness is the same. 
<p>　　Trueness is falseness, and falseness is trueness. 
<p>　　Why? 
<p>　　Because trueness does not entail birth and death, but falseness entails birth and death.
<p>　　That is why there is birth and death once you stir your mind and start thinking, but there is neither birth nor death once you keep your mind in a quiet state and do not think.  
<p>　　This is fascinating.
<p>　　What is so good about the Diamonds Sutra? 
<p>　　It is simple and clear, nothing verbose. 
<p>　　It tells the truth that "everything with form is unreal".  
<p>　　Once you truly let go, you will become a Bodhisattva and set an example for others.
<p>　　The Chinese cleverly live up to that example through the Confucian practice of composure, kindness, courtesy, moderation and modesty. 
<p>　　Wherever a Confucius follower may be, you can see that he does not scramble to win; he is modest, he steps back. 
<p>　　The first and the last is actually the same. 
<p>　　The one stepping back is wiser than the one advancing.  
<p>　　The one who has stepped back had a pure mind. 
<p>　　Without a pure mind he would not be able to take that step backwards. 
<p>　　If he were pretending, he would have failed in doing that. 
<p>　　A pure mind leads to the realm of the saints. 
<p>　　That is why the Chinese traditional way of life is unique in the world. 
<p>　　Inwardly, there is no greed, hatred, delusion, arrogance and suspicion, it is the realm of the Buddha. 
<p>　　Outwardly, there is composure, kindness, courtesy, moderation and modesty, it is the realm of Confucianism.
<p>　　The interior and the exterior of a person is the same thing. 
<p>　　They are two sides of the same coin.
<p>　　Both Confucianism and Buddhism have achieved it, but not the others.
<p>　　If Confucius were born in India, the Indian would have called him a Buddha. 
<p>　　If Buddha Shakyamuni were born in China, the Chinese would have called him a saint.
<p>　　Let us eat this together. 
<p>　　Eating without stirring the mind, without a thought. 
<p>　　This is how we should practise Buddhism. 
<p>　　If people praise one another, the communities will thrive.　　</html>
