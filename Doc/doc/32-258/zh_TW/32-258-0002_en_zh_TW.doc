<p>　　It is important to incorporate religion, in an educational framework. 
<p>　　The British are doing this now. 
<p>　　The Prince of Wales is directing every religion to an educational framework. 
<p>　　This is perfectly correct.
<p>　　People take religion to be superstition.
<p>　　The fact is: religion itself is education. 
<p>　　What kind of education? 
<p>　　The education of love. 
<p>　　" God loves humanity ",hence, the education of love. 
<p>　　This is great! 
<p>　　He's rather active in this, he's dedicated to training teachers. 
<p>　　Nowadays teachers are generally in very short supply, it’s the same both in the East and the West. 
<p>　　To set up schools is no problem but where do you find the teachers?
<p>　　There're no teachers, So, to train teachers must be the priority.
<p>　　To start a " PhD in Harmony " programme in the University, it'll take 3 years to complete a doctorate programme. 
<p>　　In practice these Doctors of Philosophy in Harmony will be the Religion Instructors of their own faith.
<p>　　They must explain the religion texts clearly and accurately. 
<p>　　Then relying on God's teachings, they should find God's love and store it in their own heart. 
<p>　　Everyone will then learn to put God's love into practice by loving each other. 
<p>　　God's love is unbiased. 
<p>　　It doesn't involve choice or preference. 
<p>　　It's love that is fair, genuine and unconditional. 
<p>　　This is a great idea!
<p>　　So the main purpose of setting up this 3-year Ph.D. programme is to train religious officials recommended by every religion. 
<p>　　We reckon there will be at least 30 holders of a doctorate in Harmony in 3 years' time. 
<p>　　That means there will be 30 Religion Instructors. 
<p>　　So regardless of their individual faith, they will all pass on the message of universal love.
<p>　　After successfully training 30 teachers in 3 years' time, we can upgrade the School and proceed to set up the College of Religion Education. 
<p>　　We'll have by then 30 teachers. 
<p>　　That'll do.
<p>　　The College of Religion Education is actually the University of Religion. 
<p>　　It's called a College and not a University because there aren't that many teachers. 
<p>　　It'll take 7 years to graduate.
<p>　　We reckon that in 7 years' time we can successfully train 100 to 150 Religion Instructors who will have obtained their doctorate and will be able to lecture on their respective religious texts. 
<p>　　With as many as 100 to 150 teachers, we can then formally establish a University of Religion 
<p>　　to help the Religion Instructors of every faith in the world to obtain their doctorate and be qualified as professors.
<p>　　And so the first University will be set up. 
<p>　　That's a good thing. 
<p>　　The British take a pragmatic approach, starting with teacher-training. 
<p>　　In 10 years' time there will be sufficient teaching staff and the University of Religion will then materialize.
<p>　　To save Chinese traditional culture is to save humanity.
<p>　　It is logical and admirable for Chinese to learn Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism as these are their heritage.  
<p>　　This is about saving the world, the sacred mission. 
<p>　　It is no trivial matter.
<p>　　For ourselves, it would suffice so long we have enough food to eat and enough clothing to keep warm.
<p>　　What bliss! 
<p>　　To save the culture, to save humanity!　　</html>
