<p>　　Respected President Brinley Jones and Mrs Stephanie Jones, Mayor Ann Bowen Morgan and Mr Densil Morgan, Mr Ben Lake MP, colleagues and students, ladies and gentlemen, good evening!
<p>　　I am very delighted to be a part of this friendship dinner with all of you! It has been a few months since our last friendship dinner, which many people have missed. The Academy of Sinology has been in operation for two years. I would like to thank you for your support and the cares given towards the academy. This friendship dinner is a good opportunity for us to express our gratitude and respect to you all.
<p>　　In July this year, we lost my very good friend, Provost Professor Clayton Zhou, who was a great teacher and a caring father of the academy. We do miss his candid and kind words, as well as his extensive and mastery knowledge. His departure has been a great loss to us. Fortunately, we have younger generation successors who can shoulder his responsibilities and continue to lead the academy in the hope to accomplish Clayton’s unfinished mission.
<p>　　The purpose of this friendship dinner is to celebrate Christmas, to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ. God loves all people, so he sent his beloved son to Earth to bring salvation to human beings from sins and sufferings.
<p>　　The Bible says, “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”
<p>　　It also says, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” Furthermore, it says, “Love one another, as I have loved you.”
<p>　　It even says, “Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may become the children of your Father in heaven.” “. . . forgive each other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.” 
<p>　　God’s love is equal, universal, unconditional and true. We have all inherited the love of God. Therefore, we should learn from God and treat others with true love. If we are able to do so, our society will be filled with warmth and harmony.
<p>　　The importance of love has been emphasized by all major religions. Love is the core value of all religions, as well as the foundation for religious cohesion. Nowadays, conflicts are increasingly caused by misunderstandings among people of different faiths. To resolve these issues, we need to advocate the sacred universal love of all faiths and religions. If we love others, we will not harm one another. Love can resolve all conflicts. With the spirit of love, different religions can work together facilitating harmony in our society, then we can build a paradise on Earth.
<p>　　Lampeter is a lovely town with lovely people living here. It is a town of love and harmony. All of us hope that everyone can spread love further and further, and reach more and more people. Let’s build a harmonious society starting with love from each of us, and we can start with this friendship dinner! 
<p>　　I am sure everyone will enjoy a wonderful dinner! I wish all of you peace and longevity! May there be everlasting harmony and prosperity in Lampeter! Thank you. 　　</html>
