<p>　　Learning ‘God Loves All’  (Episode 3)  26.08.2018  Exhibition Centre London  No:21-786-0003_en
<p>　　诸位法师、诸位同学，大家好。今天我们继续来谈谈「神爱世人」。前面有一个报告还没讲完，今天我们继续讲。
<p>　　Venerables, fellow students, my warmest greetings to you all. Today, we will continue to talk about ‘God loves all Beings’. We did not finish the report last time. So we will continue from there.
<p>　　英国历史哲学家汤恩比博士曾经说到，所有宗教的创始人都是那个时代伟大的社会教育家，一直到今天，我们还深受影响。由此可知，宗教教育深得人心。如果我们疏忽了，失去对宗教的信仰，那就是文明走向崩溃的时刻。
<p>　　The British historian Arnold Toynbee once said that the founders of all religions were great social educators of their times. Up until now, we are all still deeply influenced by these religious teachings. It is hence clear that religious education is widely welcomed and supported by many. If we neglect it and totally lose our faith in religion, it is perhaps the beginning for human civilisations to collapse.
<p>　　我们不断的接触宗教、认识经典，在这当中深深体会到，一切宗教的真神与圣哲都是一体的，他们所有的核心就是一个「爱」字，宗教教育就是爱的教育。它的核心，就是引导人们去把爱发扬光大，让人们真正懂得，如何用一颗无私的心去爱他人、去爱一切生命、去爱整个宇宙。爱是自性、是真心第一德。
<p>　　We have been in close contact with different religions and studying their sacred texts. During the process, we feel deeply that God, the true divinity, and sages of all religions are one. The core of all religious teachings is ‘love’. Religious education is the education of love. Its core is to guide us to promote ‘love’ and to truly understand how sincerely and unconditionally to love other people, love all living beings and love the whole universe. ‘Love’ is the first virtue of our self-nature, our true mind.
<p>　　我们学习宗教，受经典的薰习，「上帝爱世人」就是宗教的核心。我遇到过不少人，问我，宗教是什么？我告诉他，宗教就是爱，宗教是教育，宗教是爱的教育。如何学会把神爱世人这种大公无私的爱，放在我们自己心上，我们代表上帝去爱世人，上帝爱世人这就落实了；否则的话，上帝爱世人是一句空话。
<p>　　We study religions and we are steadily learning the sacred texts. ‘God loves all beings’ is the core of all religions. I have met many people who asked me what religion is. I told them, ‘Religion is love. Religion is education. Religion is the education of love.’ So how do we keep God’s selfless love in our hearts? When we love all human beings on behalf of God, ‘God loves all beings’ is then put into practice. Otherwise, ‘God loves all beings’ is only empty words.
<p>　　我们追问一句，上帝怎么爱世人？这个理、事我们都要搞清楚、搞明白。上帝的爱，是大公无私的爱、是没有条件的爱。为什么？几乎每个宗教都给我们讲到众神是一体的，往后我们学习每个宗教，在经文里面就看到了，「众神一体，宗教一家」。如果我们能够契入这种认知、这个境界，那么我们距离宗教的大团结就不远了。宗教团结带给人类真正的幸福，众神欢喜。
<p>　　We can then ask further, ‘How does God love all beings?’ In this regard, we need to be clear about the rationale and practice. God’s love is selfless and unconditional. Why is it? Almost every religion tells us that all divinities are one entity. When we study each religion in the future, we will find in sacred texts that ‘all divinities are one entity, and all religions are one family’. When we can attain this understanding and state of mind, we are not far from reaching a great religious cohesion among all faiths. Religious cohesion will bring real happiness to humanity, and all divinities will be pleased.
<p>　　这种无私的大爱、真实的爱心，就是上帝的大爱、佛陀的慈悲，他们彼此是一不是二。他们其实，所有宗教经典里面讲的爱，是同一个爱。宗教的信徒，特别是神职人员，都能够代表上帝去爱世人时，上帝的天堂就会降临到这个地球上。我们确实都有责任，把上帝的天堂带到这个苦难的人间。
<p>　　This selfless, genuine and universal love is God’s love and the Buddha’s compassion. They are one, not two. In fact, the love mentioned in the sacred texts of all religions is the same. When religious followers, especially clergies, can love all human beings on behalf of God, God’s Heaven will come to Earth. All of us have indeed the responsibility of bringing God’s Heaven to this suffering world.
<p>　　多年来我们团结宗教，我是在一九九八年、一九九九年在新加坡尝试着做，做成功了，用了一年的时间。二ＯＯＯ年我移民到澳洲，在澳洲也做实验，做成功了，时间长一些。新加坡一年做圆满，澳洲我们用了比较长的时间，我记得好像是十三年，我们才做成功。现在这个社会，没有好的榜样，大家很难相信，最好是做出来，他看到了，亲身体会到了，他才相信。怎么做？人与人之间最重要的是接触，如果不接触就难了。
<p>　　We have engaged in bringing religions together for many years. I attempted this effort in Singapore between 1998 and 1999 and it was successful. It took us one year. In 2000 I immigrated to Australia and tested there. It was also a success, but took us a little longer. It took us one year in Singapore to reach where we were. In Australia it took us longer, I think it took about 13 years. In today’s society it is hard for people to believe things without seeing good examples. So the best approach is to witness and experience religious cohesion personally How do we approach it? The most important thing between human beings is getting in touch with each other. Without closer contact, unity and cohesion is difficult to achieve.
<p>　　我在澳洲图文巴这个城市，怎么样跟大家交朋友？我初到澳洲的时候，买了个教堂，把教堂改成佛堂，除了把十字架换成阿弥陀佛之外，教堂丝毫没有改变。没想到得到当地人的欢喜，知道我们不破坏文化，我们要保留文化，他们在旁边看。开幕这一天，我们邀请了街道上两边的邻居，参加我们移民到图文巴，建立一个佛堂欢喜的日子。晚上我们用晚宴、素食招待他们，给他们做报告，我们为什么到这边来。想做实验，我们所理想的，「宗教是一家，众神是一体」。
<p>　　How did we make friends with the local people in Toowoomba? When I first arrived at Australia, I purchased a church and renovated it into a Buddhist hall. Except for replacing the cross with a statue of Amitabha Buddha, everything else in the church remained unchanged. Unexpectedly, the local people were very pleased with what we did because they could see that we wanted to preserve their culture. They were able to see what we have done. On the first day of opening the Buddhist hall, we invited neighbours on both sides of the street to join us and celebrate the happy day of opening the hall and our immigration to Toowoomba. In the evening we served them all a vegetarian dinner and reported to them why we immigrated to Toowoomba. We wanted to test on our ideal of ‘all religions are one family, and all divinities are one entity’.
<p>　　晚宴散会的时候，有十几个街坊来看我，我接见他们，他们提出问题：「法师，你办这个活动我们很欢喜，能不能常常办？」我非常欢喜，一个星期办一次，他们都皆大欢喜。所以，我们在那里团结大众，用的是温馨晚宴，每个礼拜六晚上举行一次，大家欢欢喜喜在一块聚餐、在一块交流。他们对佛教不了解，很好奇，喜欢问，我们为他解答。一年一年过去，都没有改变，一直到今天，还是星期六晚宴，温馨晚宴。
<p>　　Towards the end of the dinner, over ten neighbours came to see me and asked me a question, ‘Venerable, we really like the activity you organised. Could you please do it more often?’ I was very pleased with their suggestion and decided to hold the dinner once a week. They were all very happy. Therefore we organised friendship dinner to bring people together. Every Saturday evening we held a friendship dinner. People gathered together around the table and communicated with one another with ease and joy. They did not know what Buddhism was and they were curious. They liked asking us questions and we answered all questions. Year after year, we have not changed this arrangement. Up until today, Friendship Dinner is still running on every Saturday.
<p>　　我们心目当中，就是佛陀的慈悲、上帝的大爱，突破了宗教的界限，宗教与宗教之间和睦相处。十三年，十几个宗教团体，他们的领导、代表人来找我。告诉我，他们对我们在图文巴这么多年的贡献非常感谢，我们愿意团结起来，给其他的大众做一个榜样：宗教是可以团结的，宗教是可以变成一家人，相亲相爱，互助合作；做到了，我看到很欢喜。
<p>　　To us, things like friendship dinner are the expressions of the Buddha’s compassion and God’s love. It transcends religious boundaries and consequently harmony is present amongst different religious groups. Thirteen years later, leaders and representatives of over ten religious groups in Toowoomba visited me. They told me that they were very grateful to the contribution that we made in Toowoomba, and that they were willing to join us in unity and set a good example for the rest of the community, a message that says religions can work together and different religious groups can become a family, loving and caring for one another and cooperating with each other. We have done it and I am very pleased.
<p>　　去年三月，巴黎联合国教科文组织有九位大使，我们邀请他们到图文巴来考察、来观光，他们看到了，对于我们常常在一起交流、讨论，希望宗教团结、希望宗教回归教育。图文巴看过之后，这个信心升起来，他们回来做了一份详细报告，还附带为我要了一个办公室，就是我们今天活动这个场所，我起了个名字——「净空之友社」。这是教科文组织长年的做团结宗教、做宗教教育，我们担任了这一门。这正是我们的愿望，是联合国他们章程上的主要活动。
<p>　　Last March, we invited nine UNESCO ambassadors to visit and inspect Toowoomba. They witnessed us frequently communicating and exchange ideas with different religious groups as well as our hope for religious cohesion and restoring religion as education. After their visit to Toowoomba, the ambassadors gained confidence. Upon their return to UNESCO, they delivered a detailed report and also applied for an office for me, which is where we are now. I named it ‘The Association of Chin Kung’s Friends’. We are here to take on the responsibility for helping UNESCO engage in long-term activities in terms of realizing religious cohesion and religious education. This is what we wish to contribute and it is now part of what UNESCO does.
<p>　　这个学社成立了，使用这个摄影棚做我们的活动工具、做我们的教室，我这今天是第二天。由于身体比去年差很多，古人所讲的年岁不饶人，去年有感觉、不严重，今年比去年严重很多。
<p>　　The Association is now formally established and we use this recording studio as our tool and classroom. This is the second day of using it. My general health is worse off than last year. Just like said the old saying: ‘Time spares no man.’ Last year I could feel it to some degree. But this year I feel that age is truly catching up with me.
<p>　　我讲经六十年，有同学，这有心人，帮助我做整理，搜集六十年讲经的这些教材、笔记，很完整的一些资料，我自己看到都感到惊讶。过去年轻，身体不错，有体力、有精神，一天可以讲四个小时。当年讲《华严经》，没有感觉得到累，音声宏亮。有不少的一部分，留着有录影带，录影、录像，我们讲录像，现在依然可以用。我让同学们在这个里面，选择我们大家需要听的、想听的经，我这里有现成的，可以用卫星或者是网路来传播，提供初学同学们做参考。这些资料，听过的人很多，依教修行的人也很多，确实带给我们信解行证。
<p>　　I have delivered Dharma lectures for over 60 years. Some thoughtful students have helped collect and compile various lecture materials and notes of Dharma talks given in these 60 years. The collection is fairly complete. I am very surprised at seeing them. When I was younger, in good health and energetic, I could regularly give four hours of lectures every day. When I delivered talks on ‘The Avatamsaka Sutra’, I never felt tired and my voice was loud and clear. Majority of my lectures and talks were recorded in audio and visual formats and they can still be used. I have requested fellow students to select the parts of talks that people needs and would want to listen to. These readily available recordings can be broadcasted via satellite or the Internet as a reference for beginners. Many people have listened to these recordings. Many of them also put what they have learned into practice. The recordings indeed help us believe, understand, practise and attain our goal.
<p>　　信是信心，对佛法生起信心；解，是对于经典明白了、理解了；行，是依教修行，经典里面所说的，我们完全接受过来，变成我们自己的思想、言行，甚至于对我们日常生活、我们从事的这些行业都有很大的帮助。所以，证明佛教是教育，我们将来把这个扩大，所有的宗教都是教育。
<p>　　To believe is to gain confidence, to gain the confidence in Buddhism. To understand is to comprehend classical texts. To practise is to apply what we have learned and conduct our lives accordingly. What the scriptures stated, we turn these teachings into our thoughts, speech and actions. It will greatly benefit our daily lives and help us in different lines of work. Subsequently, it proves that Buddhism is education. When we expand it further, all religions are education.
<p>　　教什么？教伦理、教道德、教因果、教圣贤的智慧。这四门在今天教育疏忽了，学校教育，甚至于宗教教育，都很少讲这四门功课，这四门功课非常重要，我们把它找回来。我们来做，希望由我们来牵头；终极的目标，希望所有的宗教我们集合成一体，我们确实认知，所有宗教的神圣都是一个真神的化身。换句话说，所有宗教的神圣是一个真神，「众神一体，宗教一家」。宗教可以复兴，西方的社会可以恢复秩序，社会安定和谐；东方恢复儒释道的教学，中国传统的教育。
<p>　　So what does this education teach? It teaches us ethics, morality, causality and sages’ wisdom. The four subjects are neglected in the education system today. School education, even some religious teachings, hardly mentions these four subjects. But they are very important and we must bring them back. We will take the lead and do it first. Our ultimate goal is to bring all religions on board and act as one. We do recognise that divinities of all religions are different manifestations of one true God. In other words, the divinities and sages of all religions are one and ‘all divinities are one entity, and all religions are one family’. Religion can be revived, social order in the West can be restored, and society will gain stability and harmony. The East must revive the teachings of Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism as well as China’s traditional education.
<p>　　在今天，无论是中国、外国，我们细心去观察，具足伦理、道德、因果，中国有。其他的有没有？有，我们在各个宗教经典里面看到，不是没有；没有人讲、没有人提倡、没有人落实，所以没办法传出来。我们今天明白了、认识了，从「神爱世人」这里做起。我们要把所有宗教经典里面，所讲的「神爱世人」、所讲的「众神一体」、所说的「宗教一家」，从我们身上做出来给大家看。用这个方法恢复西方的宗教教育、恢复中国传统的教育，来帮助社会、帮助地球化解冲突、促进安定和谐。这是我们净空之友社要做的事业。
<p>　　In the world today whether it is in China or any other country, when we observe carefully, there are teachings of ethics, morality and causality everywhere. These teachings can be found in every country in the world. We have seen them in the sacred texts of all religions. The problem today is that no one talks about them, no one advocates them, and no one practises them. It is why it is difficult to pass them on to more people. Today, we have gained a clear understanding that we should start from ‘God loves all beings’. We should start from ourselves and practise what is written in the sacred texts, ‘God loves all beings’, ‘all divinities are one entity’, ‘all religions are one family’. We should use this approach to restore religious education in the West and traditional education in China, and subsequently help resolve conflicts on Earth and facilitate social stability and harmony. This is what we need to do at the Association here in UNESCO.
<p>　　今天时间到了，我们就讲到此地。祝福大家，身心健康，法喜充满！
<p>　　Well, time is up. This is it for today. May you all enjoy healthy mind and body, and be filled with Dharma happiness!　　</html>
