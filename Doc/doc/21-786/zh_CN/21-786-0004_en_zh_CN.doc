<p>　　诸位法师、诸位同学，大家好。今天我们继续来谈《神爱世人》。
<p>　　Venerables, fellow students, my warmest greetings to you all. We will continue to talk about ‘God Loves All Beings’.
<p>　　宗教团结的深化，必须要建立在各宗教彼此深入学习对方的经典，在这个基础上才能够达成。各宗教的传教师与信徒们，都可以认识到彼此经典的共通之处，彼此都是同一位真神的子民。
<p>　　The deepening of religious cohesion must be on the basis of all religious groups delving into one another’s sacred texts. Only with this basis can we succeed. In so doing, the preachers and followers of all faiths will come to understand the commonalities among the sacred texts of one another’s religion and that they are all the children of one true God.
<p>　　有鉴于对于各宗教经典的认识与学习是如此的重要，我们这一次从世界十一大宗教的圣典之中，撷取出各宗教经典中的一些精华经句，让读者认识到，众神确实是一体的，他们都拥有着一体不二的大爱、一体不二的真心。这是我们学习的基础、是我们学习的核心，否则的话，宗教团结的意义就失掉了。《神爱世人》这个小册子，可以帮助我们契入境界。
<p>　　Considering the great importance of understanding and learning the sacred texts of each religion, we selected a number of excerpts of the most essential teachings from the sacred texts of eleven major religions in the world. They enable readers to understand that all divinities are truly one entity and that they all have the same universal love and true mind. This is the basis of our study as well as the core of it. Otherwise, the significance of religious cohesion would be lost. The booklet ‘God Loves All Beings’ helps us reach this state of mutual understanding.
<p>　　我们知道，学习的根夹在这一句话里头：一体不二的大爱、一体不二的真心。首先肯定，完全没有怀疑，从经典上认识，每个宗教都建立在神圣教诲的基础上。我们要怎样把这个爱找到？这个爱，神圣的爱，是从真心流露出来的，妄心里头没有。什么叫妄心？有分别、有执着是妄心；或者我们总的说一句，起心动念是妄心，分别、执着是妄心。必须要把这个妄心放下，真心就现前。真心就是上帝的爱心；真心，一切众生跟上帝没有两样。
<p>　　We know that the roots of learning lie in the sentence ‘all divinities have the same universal love and true mind’. First of all, we must be without any doubt that, according to the scriptures, every religion is based on sacred teachings. So how do we find this love? This love, the sacred love, comes from our true mind, but not from our false mind. So what is a false mind? It is a mind with differentiation and attachment. Or to sum up, a mind that gives rise to random thought is a false mind, a mind that has differentiation and attachment is a false mind. We must let go of the false mind and then the true mind will appear. God’s love for all is the manifestation of a true mind, and there is no difference between the true mind of all beings and that of God.
<p>　　所以说到最后，我们会体认到，经教里面所说的这些句子，我们节录下来了，往下我们都能看到，不但众神是一体，整个宇宙是真心所现，妄心所变。真心显露的是天堂、是极乐世界，妄心所现的是十法界；十法界跟极乐世界、跟天堂，也是一不是二。
<p>　　It is why in the end we will understand what these excerpts from various scriptures tell us: not only all divinities are one entity, but the entire universe arise due to the true mind and the universe changes in accordance to the false mind. The true mind reveals Heaven and the Land of Ultimate Bliss whereas the false mind changes them into the ten dharma-realms (our universe is included within). The ten dharma-realms, the Land of Ultimate Bliss and Heaven are one, not two.
<p>　　经典上都说得好，「凡所有相，皆是虚妄」，这是真的不是假的。我们能把虚妄的放下，不要放在心上，这个时候我们的心就是真心。那些开悟的人、明心见性的人，跟我们的差别在哪里？就在这个地方。明心见性的人，眼见色，不起心不动念，看得清清楚楚、了了分明；耳听声音，听得清楚、听得明白，也是不起心不动念。我们从这里就了解，古圣先贤他们修行证果的秘诀在哪里。搞清楚了、搞明白了，要学！学就叫功夫、学就叫修行。行就是动，行动。凡夫的行动，里面有妄想、分别、执着，有烦恼、有习气；明心见性的人，他六根在六尘境界上，真正是不起心不动念、不分别不执着，差别就在此地。
<p>　　It is stated in a Buddhist sutra that ‘All phenomena is illusive and unreal’. This is true, not false. When we let go of all that is illusive and unreal, remove them from our minds, at this very moment, our minds are the true mind. What is the difference between us and those who have attained enlightenment and witnessed the true nature? It lies right here. When they see anything, no thought arises in their minds but they can see it all clearly and thoroughly. When they hear anything, they can hear it all clearly but no thought arises in their minds. From here, we can see the secret of the cultivation and attainment of ancient sages. Once we fully and clearly understand what it is, we also want to learn it! To learn it is to attain the ability, to learn is to do or practise it. When ordinary people do something, there are wandering thoughts, differentiation and attachment as well as afflictions and aquired habits in their minds. As for those who have attained enlightenment and attained their true nature, there are no thought, differentiation and attachment when their six sense  are in contact with worldly phenomena  This is the difference.
<p>　　明心见性不是要离开世间，那你就错了！世间是离不开的，真妄是在一体，你怎么能离得开？怎么办？佛菩萨教给我们，所有宗教的教主、上帝，以及上帝的使者、教化六道众生这些大德、大师，他们不但教给我们，而且给我们做模范、做榜样；我们能契入他们的境界，俗话说「得道」，你得到了，得到什么？你得到明心见性的道路，你就晓得怎么走法，就是六根在六尘境界上学习。眼见色是修行，是学习明心见性。现在开始下手，就是所见的色相，不分别、不执着、不放在心上，就对了。
<p>　　If anyone thinks that they must leave this world in order to attain enlightenment, then they are completely wrong! They cannot leave this world to attain it. Truth and falsehood are one and the same, how could they leave the world to attain awakening? So what should we do? Well, Buddhas, bodhisattvas, the founders of all religions, God as well as God’s messengers and those who taught and reformed all beings in the six realms, all of them not only taught us but also were good role models for us. So when the state of our minds is the same as that of theirs, we will have attained the right “Path”. What shall we have attained? We shall have attained the path to attaining enlightenment. By then, we shall know how to get there, that is, how to use our six senses when in contact with this world to properly conduct our learning. For example, when our eyes see a form or a phenomenon, it is a chance to cultivate ourselves and learning to attain enlightenment . Start from this moment onward, whenever we see any form or phenomenon, be it beautiful or ugly, we do not differentiate the form, nor do we have any attachment to it, and lastly, we let go of the form from our minds. This is the right way to cultivate.
<p>　　一般凡夫他的问题在哪里？问题是把所有的现象，真的、假的，统统放在心上。他不知道真心、本性里面是清净的，一尘不染，虽见色，没放在心上；虽闻声，也没有放在心上；乃至于鼻嗅香、舌尝味，都不放在心上。所以称它叫一如、真如。真如是什么意思？真妄是一不是二，叫一如、叫真如。不起分别、不生执着，这是入门的地方，要用功夫去练。你真正做到了，方东美先生教我的一句话你也得到了，「学佛是人生最高的享受」，得到了；我得到了、你也得到了、他也得到了、人人得到了。怎么得到的？不起心不动念、不分别不执着、不放在心上，就对了。放在心上的是凡夫，把真心变成妄心，把本性变成习性，问题就出在这里。我证实了方先生这句话，「人生最高的享受」。
<p>　　And what would ordinary people do? Ordinary people cannot let go of any form or phenomenon, true or false. Everything is on their minds. They do not know that the true mind or self-nature is pure without a single speck of dust. Although a person with a true mind sees a form or phenomenon, that form touches not the mind within; although they hear a sound, that sound is not present in the mind. As for what they smell or taste, they let go of it. It is why it is called ‘one self-nature’ or the ‘true self-nature’. What does ‘true self-nature’ mean? True and false are one, not two, and they are called ‘one self-nature’ or the ‘true self-nature’. Do not differentiate or be attached to anything---this is where we start our learning. We need to practise it with genuine effort. When you can truly practise it, you will attain what Professor Fang Dongmei told me – ‘Practising the Buddha’s teachings is the highest enjoyment of one’s life’. I attain it, you attain it, they attain it, and everyone attains it. How is it attained? Stop from having wandering thoughts, no more differentiation, no more attachment and do let go of everything on your mind. This is the right way. Those who cannot let go of things are ordinary people. They have changed their true mind into false mind and changed their self-nature into habitual nature. This is where the problem is. I can testify what Professor Fang said – ‘the highest enjoyment of one’s life’.
<p>　　有人问我：我修了几十年了，烦恼重重，没有得到安乐，你是怎么得到的？我告诉他：你要跟我学，你也会得到，学什么？不放在心上。这句话说得容易，做起来很难。为什么？你已经把起心动念、分别执着养成一种习惯；眼见色立刻就起心动念，耳闻声立刻也起心动念，六根在六尘境界上，个个都忙着起心动念，这麻烦可大了！心上有起心动念叫做妄心，不是真心。把起心动念放下、分别执着放下，心上什么都没有，那是真心、那是自性。千经万论帮助我们认识诸法实相，一切法的真相认识；认识之后，认识是在解，信、解、行、证，认识是在解，你没修行。行是什么？是放下。这一放下，你的认识就变成智慧，不是烦恼。
<p>　　Someone asked me, ‘I’ve cultivated for decades, but I still have much afflictions and without peace or happiness. How did you do it?’ I told him, ‘If you learn from me, you’ll also achieve it. What do you need to learn? Let go of things from your mind.’ This sentence is easy to say, but hard to do. Why? It is because you have developed a habit of thinking, differentiating and being attached to various things. Whenever you see or hear something, thoughts immediately arise in your mind. When your six senses are in contact with the world, all of them are busy with creating more wanderingthoughts. This is where the real trouble is! So long as thoughts are arising in our minds, our minds are the false mind, not the true mind anymore. Let go of wandering thoughts, let go of thoughts of differentiation and let go of attachment. Let go of everything in the mind. This is the true mind and this is self-nature. Numerous sutras and sacred texts help us understand the true reality of all phenomena in the world. Once we understand the truth, as mentioned in the previous lesson, the four learning steps are believing, understanding, practising and attaining. The step of “understanding” is only knowing the truth but without the practise. So what do we practised? “Let go” is the practise. Once you let go of things, your understanding will turn into wisdom and it is no longer afflictions.
<p>　　放下是你的修行。所以我向章嘉大师请教，佛门有没有方法让我们很快就契入？他老人家听了我这个问题之后，看着我，我看着他，我们两个对看了半个小时。他看着我，我不知道什么意思，他是在等我静下来，不静下来，老师讲的你不相信。半个小时就像入定一样，定了半个小时，心清净了，没有杂念了，他说了一个字：有。那我们的注意力就集中了，又错了，又起心动念了，他就又不说了，大概又看了十分钟。前面三十分钟，定下来了，他说个有，我们的心又动了、又起分别执着，有了，所以他就不讲了。十分钟之后，我就又定下来，告诉我：「看得破、放得下，看破帮助你放下，放下帮助你看破。」我就明白这个方法了，佛法的修行是什么？看破、放下，看破是智慧，放下是功夫。
<p>　　Learn to “let go” is how you should cultivate yourself. I sought guidance from my teacher, the Changkya Khutukhtu, ‘Is there a quicker way of getting into Buddhism?’ Having heard my question, he looked at me.  And I looked at him back. We looked at one another in silence for half an hour. I did not know what he meant by looking at me at that time. Later, I realised that he was waiting for my mind to settle down. If my mind did not settle down, I would not take in his words and I would not have believed what my teacher said. That half an hour was much like entering into meditation for me. After that, my mind was pure without any thought. He then said one word, ‘Yes.’ Well, hearing his answer, I immediately focused my attention to what he was about to say. Wrong move! Because wandering thoughts arised in my mind. Once again, he stopped speaking. This time, he waited for about 10 minutes. You see, in the first 30 minutes, I settled down my mind and he said one word ‘yes’. After that, my mind was stirred and random thoughts together with differentiation and attachment was present. As I had all of those, he did not speak further. Ten minutes later, my mind settled down again. He then told me, “See through and let go”. “See through the truth of everything will help you let go of them. Letting go of things helps you see through them.” Then, I understood the method. What is the cultivation and practice of Buddhism? It is to see through things and let go of them. Seeing through things is wisdom, and letting go of them is real practise.
<p>　　在日常生活当中，你要想得到受用，不能不把人事统统放下，不放在心上，你就有智慧。好处太多了！你能慢慢的入佛境界，佛菩萨明心见性，你也明心见性了。明心见性是自性本有的，不是外头来的。功夫也是本有的，功夫是禅定，心里有事就不定了；妄想、分别、执着统统放下，心定下来。定生智慧，智慧是自性本有的。然后经愈看愈深入，它的深度、它的广度慢慢你就看到。这个我们不能不知道，希望同学们慢慢琢磨。
<p>　　In our daily lives, if you want to benefit from the practice of the Buddha’s teachings, you must let go of all affairs. Letting go will help us gain wisdom. There are just too many benefits from such practice. Gradually, you will attain the state of the minds of Buddhas. Buddhas and bodhisattvas have attained enlightenment. You will also attain it. Enlightenment is something innate to our self-nature, and it is not gained from outside. The ability to practise is also innate to us and it is also meditative concentration. When there is something on our minds, we cannot enter into meditative concentrate. So when we let go of wandering thoughts, differentiation and attachment, our minds will be able to achieve meditative concentration. Meditative concentration gives rise to wisdom, which is innate in our self-nature. Subsequently, we shall be able to delve deeper into the sutras and gradually grasp the width and depth of them. This is something we must know. I hope that fellow students can slowly contemplate it.
<p>　　最好，这是福报，一生能够不管人、不管事、不管钱。把人放下、把事放下，事来的时候做，做完了不放在心上，钱放下。方先生这句话，「学佛是人生最高的享受」，你就体会到了。
<p>　　It is best kind of fortune if we do not have to manage people, affairs and money in our lifetime. We should learn to let go of people and affairs. So when there is something we have to do, we do it properly but let go of all of it after we are done. We let go of money too. At that moment, you will fully experience what Professor Fang said ‘Practising the Buddha’s teachings is the highest enjoyment in one’s life’.
<p>　　时间到了，我们就学习到此地。
<p>　　OK, time is up. This is it for today. Thank you.　　</html>
