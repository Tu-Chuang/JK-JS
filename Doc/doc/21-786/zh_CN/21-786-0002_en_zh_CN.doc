<p>　　Learning ‘God Loves All’  (Episode 2)  25.08.2018  Exhibition Centre London  No:21-786-0002_en
<p>　　诸位同学、诸位朋友，今天我们开辟这个单元——《神爱世人》。为什么要开这个单元？便利于对宗教咨询的同学们。这些年来，我们做宗教团结的工作，有一点成就，现在大家都知道，宗教团结是有必要的，因为它能够帮助我们化解冲突、化解对立、促进社会安定和谐。
<p>　　Fellow students, friends, Today, we will resume the learning of ‘God Loves All Beings’. Why do we learn about it? It is for the convenience of those who would like to know about religion. Over the years, we have engaged in bringing religious cohesion and achieved some success. All of you are aware now that religious cohesion is essential because it helps resolve conflicts, confrontations and promote social stability and harmony.
<p>　　我是从二十六岁，遇到方东美先生，我跟他学哲学。最后一个单元，他给我讲佛经哲学，我感到很诧异，我说佛是宗教，它怎么会有哲学？老师告诉我：你还年轻（那年我二十六岁），你不知道，释迦牟尼是世界上最伟大的哲学家，大乘经典是全世界哲学的最高峰。确实我没听说过，第一次听方先生讲。
<p>　　At the age of 26, I met Professor Thomé H. Fang (Fang, Dongmei) who taught me philosophy. In the very last lesson, he taught me Buddhist philosophy. I was very surprised. I said, ‘Buddhism is a religion. How come there is philosophy in it?’ Professor Fang told me, ‘You’re still young. You do not know that Sakyamuni was the greatest philosopher in the world and Mahayana sutras are the pinnacle of philosophy in the world.’ Indeed, I had never heard comments like that before. Professor Fang was the first one who told me that.
<p>　　我接受他的教诲，在最后，总结我们的课程，他提出来，佛教是哲学，学佛是人生最高的享受。这句话很动听，对我们年轻人来说是很契机，我们听了很喜欢。真的学佛能带给我们一生幸福快乐吗？人生最高的享受？我今年九十二岁，通过六十年的学习，证明老师的话是真的，我佩服到五体投地。
<p>　　I took on what he taught me. Towards the end of that last lesson, he summed up the entire lessons and proposed that ‘Buddhism is a philosophy, and practising the Buddha’s teachings is the highest enjoyment in one’s life’. What he said was very appealing. To young men like me, it was a topic that we want to understand better. Can practising the Buddha’s teachings truly bring us happiness in life? Is it really the highest enjoyment in life? I am 92 this year. Through 60 years of learning and practising of the Buddha’s teachings, it is proven that what Professor Fang said is true, and my appreciation and admiration for his teaching is without bound.
<p>　　世界上所有宗教的创始人，都是明心见性的社会教育家。这是我跟方先生，他为我开了这门课，我非常感谢他！这堂课时间并不很长，才三、四个月，我重新认识宗教，肯定世界上所有宗教的创始人，都是明心见性的社会教育家。方老师教我这些，我通过六十年的学习，肯定他的话是正确的。
<p>　　The founders of all faiths in the world were social educators who attained true enlightenment. I am most grateful for being Professor Fang’s student and that he taught me this particular subject. Within a short span of four months, I developed a new understanding for religion and understood that the founders of all faiths in the world were enlightened social educators. My sixty-year learning proves that what Professor Fang said is true.
<p>　　「明心见性」是佛教的术语，佛教修学最高的境界就是明心见性，明心见性就叫成佛。佛陀的教育它有四个层次：信、解、行、证。第一个是讲信仰，你对它要有真诚的信心，才能够得到利益。这个道理，在中国过去，不是宗教的，是教育里面所要求的，中国古人非常重视教育。
<p>　　‘Attaining True Enlightenment’ is a Buddhist term. It is the highest level of achievement in Buddhism. Anyone who achieves it is called a Buddha. There are four learning steps in the Buddha’s education, i.e. believing, understanding, practising and attaining. The first step is to believe. You must have sincere faith before you can benefit from it. In ancient China, this principle was a prerequisite for all education. It was not meant for religions only. Chinese ancestors attached great importance to education.
<p>　　两千多年前，孔子可以说是开私人教学的，用现在的话说私人办学，做得很成功。从此之后，历代读书人都重视教学。而读书人，几乎他们唯一的前途，将来怎么生活，多半靠教学，私塾里面的老师。教的学生不多，少的五、六个，多的二、三十个；二、三十个就很多了，通常十几个学生，一个老师，私塾教学。教什么？教伦理、教道德、教因果、教圣贤承传下来的智慧，这是私塾教学的内容、教材。
<p>　　We can say, in modern terms, that Confucius started a private school over 2,000 years ago, and it was very successful. Ever since then, scholars of every generation in Chinese history took teaching seriously. For the majority of scholars, teaching was the only way of making a living. The number of students taught in private schools was not many, ranging from five to thirty. Thirty students was a large number back then. On average, a teacher taught a dozen of students at a private school. So what did they teach? They taught ethics, morality, causality and sages’ wisdom handed down generation after generation. These were the contents taught in private schools.
<p>　　一千多年前，我们的老祖宗，世世代代，从生活经验体会当中，观察小孩要受什么教育─—童蒙教育——应该教些什么。小孩从什么时候开始教？一般是三岁，上私塾。古人编的这套教材，现在我们把它搜集起来，总共有二十三种，把它印成一套，《圣学根之根》。根之根就是扎根教育，像一棵树一样，根深蒂固才能够长成大树，所以中国人重视扎根教育。
<p>　　More than 1,000 years ago, Chinese ancestors learned from life experiences, and observed that children should receive proper education with appropriate early childhood texts. When did children back then receive formal education? Generally speaking, a child attended private school at the age of three. We are able to collect twenty-three different early childhood texts. We have compiled them into the book series ‘The Root of All Roots In Sagely Learning’. ‘The Root’ means the foundations of education. It is like a tree. The deeper and firmer its roots are, the bigger the tree will grow. Therefore, the Chinese attached great importance to the foundations of education.
<p>　　对小孩教育从什么时候开始？更早的从胎教开始；也就是说，母亲怀孕，怀孕这十个月之间，就要注意怎样能养一个好儿女。母亲的责任很重，这十个月期间，心没有妄想、没有杂念，因为妄想、杂念会影响婴儿的智慧、德行，会影响。所以，凡是负面的言行、思想都不能有，要重视伦理道德，把这个影响传给下一代。小孩出生之后，母亲是第一任的老师，在婴儿面前，言行举止都要端庄，没有邪思、没有恶念。言行举止都要合乎规矩，规矩是我们自己从小学的，现在要用来教下一代。所以中国古时候的教育，大概从三岁正式入学，就入私塾，由老师教了；从出生到三岁是母亲教、父亲教。
<p>　　So when should a child start receiving education? It should start from the prenatal period. In other words, within the ten-month pregnancy, a mother should pay attention to how to nurture a good child. During this period, the mother shoulders a huge responsibility. She should refrain from erroneous thinking and wandering thoughts because they will have negative impact on the development of her foetus’ wisdom and virtue. Therefore, any negative thought, speech and action should be avoided. Meanwhile, the mother should take heed of the practice of ethics and morality and provide her foetus with positive influence. After giving birth to her baby, the mother is the first teacher. Her actions and speech must be dignified and she must not hold any dishonourable or vicious thought. All her actions and speech should be in accordance with propriety which is something we learned when young. We now should use it to educate the next generation. It was why in ancient China children attended private school and started formal education at the age of three. Between birth and three years old, children were taught by their parents at home.
<p>　　童蒙养正的教科书，古人编写的这个，在中国用了一千多年。最晚的，明清时候编的，也有七百多年。成功了，这教学成功了。小学学业完成了，向上提升，我们今天做为中学。中学学什么？学四书五经，这个里面讲求的，修身、齐家、治国、平天下。儒家讲得多，经验非常丰富。所以圣贤教育！
<p>　　The textbooks used for traditional early childhood education in China had a history of over 1,000 years. The more recent ones compiled in the Ming and Qing dynasties also had a history of more than 700 years. They had proved very successful. After completing primary education, children in ancient China progressed to what we call secondary school today. What did they learn at secondary school? They learned the Four Books and Five Classics which taught them how to cultivate themselves, manage their families in harmony, govern a country and bring peace to the world. All these are frequently mentioned in Confucian literature with abundant experiences. Therefore, it was an education aimed at nurturing future sages.
<p>　　养小孩，无论是男的是女的，都希望他长大成圣人、成贤人，是以这个为目标。跟现在不一样，现在的教育重视知识，是为了将来自己生活。古时候不是这个，古时候圣贤教育是学圣人、学贤人；像学佛，希望自己能证得阿罗汉、菩萨，当然最高的是希望能成佛。确实如此。
<p>　　For parents who undertake nursing a child, the expectation was for the child to become a sage or a saintly person regardless of the child’s gender. It was the aim of education. The aim of education is different now. Education today only focusses on the acquisition of knowledge and it is for making a living. In ancient times, sages’ education was about learning to be a sage, to be a saintly person. Similarly, learning to be a Buddha is to expect oneself to become an arhat or a bodhisattva. The highest expectation is of course to become a Buddha. It is truly the aspiration.
<p>　　所以可以说，世界上所有宗教的创始人，都是明心见性的社会教育家，跟现在教学的目的不一样。东方有儒释道，西方宗教教育，宗教教育里面，我们看西方宗教的经典，也都是至善圆满的教育。我们能够肯定，东西方教育，西方教育是宗教，宗教教育里面补足了东方的伦理、道德、因果、智慧。都是一个时代伟大的社会教育家。
<p>　　Therefore, we can say that the founders of all religions in the world were social educators who had attained True Enlightenment. Their expectation of education was different to that of today. In the East there are Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism. In the West there is religious education. With regard to religious education, the sacred texts of religions in the West are also about perfect education. We affirm that Western  religious education encompasses the elements of ethics, morality, causality and wisdom also found in Eastern education. The founders of religions and faiths were all great social educators of their times.
<p>　　汤恩比说过一句话，说得好，他说：宗教教育确实是人类不能缺少的根本教育。我们学习宗教六十年了，我觉得汤恩比这句话说得非常好，是他一生研究人类文明历史的心得总结。他也说过，当人们失去对于既有宗教的信仰时，那就是文明走向崩溃。
<p>　　Arnold Toynbee said that religious education is indeed the fundamental education that is indispensable for humankind. I have studied religion for over 60 years and I think that what Toynbee said is remarkable. It is the reflective conclusion of his lifetime study of the history of human civilisations. He also said that when people lose their faith in religion, civilisation will collapse.
<p>　　今天我们有忧虑。二Ｏ一五年，我跟威尔士大学校长见了面，我谈到我有忧虑。他问我什么忧虑？我担心东方的汉学会失传，东方是儒释道，就是中国传统文化。为什么？现在没人学了。老一代，我年轻的时候，还能找到二、三十个人，对中国国学有根柢的人，一些老教授；现在这些人都走了，剩下恐怕十个都不到。再过十年，他们全都走了，你要想学，没人教你了，这太可怕了！世界、社会为什么这么混乱？与教育的关系太大了！东方人修的，确实学做人，怎么样做一个好人，怎么样做一个真正对于社会、对人类有贡献的好人，我们学这个，现在没有人学了。我这个顾虑，校长有同感，我们谈了很长的时间，谈了三个多小时。
<p>　　We have our concerns today. In 2015 I met the vice-chancellor of the University of Wales. I told him that I was deeply concerned. He asked me what my worry was. I was concerned that sinology in the East would disappear. Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism are part of Chinese traditional culture. But few studies traditional culture now. When I was young, there were perhaps 20 to 30 old professors with a solid foundation of studies in Chinese traditional culture. Most of them have since passed away and there are perhaps less than ten left now. In another ten years, there will be no one left to teach, even if we desperately want to learn traditional culture. This prospect is dreadful! Why is the world in such chaos today? It has a great deal to do with education. In the East, education had been about learning to be a good person who genuinely contributes to society and humankind. But nowadays, no one is learning such teachings. The vice-chancellor shared the same concern as mine and we spoke for a long time, over three hours.
<p>　　我回到香港，过了一个月，校长带了他们学校的两位教授到香港来看我，我们就谈这个问题。他很积极，提出一个方案，我们共同来办一个汉学院，这就是今天的英国的汉学院。现在是第二个学期，第二个学期结束之后，下面就第三个学期。我们招收一批年轻人，给他奖学金，劝他来读书，我们希望他们这批人，能够继承中国儒释道的圣贤教育，不能让它断掉。
<p>　　A month later, the vice-chancellor visited me in Hong Kong together with two professors. Again, we talked about the same topic. He was very positive and proposed a programme – jointly establishing an academy of sinology, which is now the Academy of Sinology UK. It is the second academic term now. After it finishes, we will progress into the third academic term. We are recruiting a group of young people and provide them with scholarships as an encouragement to study. We hope that they will be able to inherit Chinese sages’ education of Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism. We must not lose these teachings.
<p>　　他们也想到宗教，校长想到宗教，提出了一个方案，办一个宗教传教师的博士班。招收二十五个学生，三年毕业，宗教传教师。把宗教传教师的学位提升，现在拿到博士学位的人不多，希望将来每个传教师都有宗教博士学位。好事情！我赞成。这个也开班了，非常难得。
<p>　　The vice-chancellor also thought about religion. So he proposed another programme – establishing a doctorate programme training preachers and teachers of different religions. The class would recruit twenty five doctorate students who will graduate after three-year of study. At present, there are not many preachers with a doctorate degree. The programme is to elevate the qualifications of preachers and we hope that every preacher will have a doctorate degree in religion in the future. This is a good deed! I fully support it. This programme has also recently started. Wonderful!
<p>　　只要有后继，继承传人，我们心就安了。希望世世代代，把宗教教育，宗教一定要回归教育，把东方的中国传统文化复兴起来。为什么？冲突可以化解。人学过圣贤、读过圣贤书，决定在一生不会跟任何人发生冲突，别人恶意的对我，我以善意回报。绝大多数的人都被感化了，恶人变成善人，坏人变成好人。
<p>　　So long as we have inheritors of these great teachings, our minds can rest in peace. We hope that every generation will carry on reviving religious education in the West and Chinese traditional culture in the East. We must restore religion as education. Why is it? It is because it will resolve conflicts. If a person has learned to be a sage and has read books on sages’ wisdom, they will not be in conflict with anyone in their life. When someone is hostile towards me, I will treat that person with goodwill in return. As a result, a great majority of people will be touched and changed. Those who are malicious will become benevolent. Those who are bad will turn good.
<p>　　中国教小朋友的，私塾，这童蒙老师，三家村的私塾老师，他们讲求信解行证，相信圣贤教育，对自己有大利益。用它来修身、用它来齐家，家庭幸福；用它来创业，你的事业有着正面的发展，好啊！如果再提升，我们用现在的话说大家容易懂，小学小私塾课程毕业之后，提升，中学，跟小学相仿佛，学四书五经。这个里面有很多讲的是治国、平天下的这些学问、知识，学了以后，可以贡献给社会、贡献给国家。你懂得治国，现在的社会，你是很好的议员；你懂得平天下，你是很好的领导。难得！
<p>　　In the past, traditional private school teachers in China also followed the four learning steps of believing, understanding, practising and attaining. They believed that sages’ education would greatly benefit oneself. Use these teachings to cultivate ourselves and manage our families, we will attain happiness at home; use them for our careers, there will be a positive development in our endeavours. Wonderful! It then progresses to the next level. Using terms that most will understand, after graduating from primary school, children in ancient China progressed to the equivalent of secondary school today and they learned the Four Books and Five Classics which are mostly about the wisdom and knowledge of governing a country properly and bringing peace to the world. With that wisdom and knowledge, a person will positively contribute to society and their country. If you know how to govern a country properly, you will be a good member of parliament. If you know how to bring peace to the world, you will be a good national leader. This is truly hard to come by!
<p>　　所以宗教是什么，我们现在搞清楚了，宗教是教育。教什么？所有宗教经典里面，我们去读它，哪一个字出现得最多？爱。所以我肯定，宗教教育是爱的教育。我们向上帝学习，学习祂的大爱；学习了之后，代表上帝，爱世人，爱地球上所有的生物；这是上帝的子女、上帝的学生。所以宗教要回归教育，宗教要办学，像现在办这个大学，好啊！学什么？学这些课程，学会爱世人、学会化解冲突。
<p>　　Hence we now have a clear understanding of what religion is. Religion is education. What does it teach? When we read the sacred texts of all religions, which word occurs most frequently? Love. Therefore I am certain that religious education is the education of love. We should learn from God and learn His universal love. After that, we should love every human being and every being on the planet on behalf of God. Such a person is a child and a student of God. Hence we need to restore religion as an education and run religious schools such as the university programme that is running. Isn’t it marvellous! What do the students study? They learn to love all people in the world and they learn to resolve conflicts.
<p>　　今天时间到了，我们就学习到此地。谢谢大家。
<p>　　Well, time is up. This is it for today. Thank you.　　</html>
