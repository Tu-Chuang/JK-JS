<p>　　诸位法师、诸位同学，大家好。今天是我在联合国教科文组织净空之友社第一次讲演，我们首先简单的做一个介绍。
<p>　　Venerables, fellow students, warmest greetings to you all. This is my first speech delivered at the Association of Master Chin Kung’s Friends at UNESCO. I would like to give you a brief introduction.
<p>　　去年三月，我们邀请联合国的大使到澳洲去参观，参观图文巴的宗教团结、族群团结，大家看了很欢喜。在过去，我们曾经做好几次的报告，虽然说得很详细，但是没有人相信；直到大使们归来，向大会做出报告，这才肯定宗教团结、族群团结的一线希望。很难得，他们做了一桩好事，在报告里面建议大会给我们一个办公室。我们接受了，正式进入联合国。这半年以来，承蒙大家的努力，同学们护持，净空之友社成立了，附设这个摄影棚也启用了。
<p>　　Last March, we invited UNESCO ambassadors to experience religious and ethnical cohesion in Toowoomba, Australia. They were all very pleased with what they saw. In the past we reported on religious and ethnical cohesion on quite a few occasions. Although the reports were very detailed, no one quite believed what was reported. Only until the ambassadors returned to UNESCO and delivered a formal report, a gleam of hope of religious and ethnical cohesion was affirmed. What the ambassadors did was remarkable and wonderful. In the report, they suggested UNESCO to offer us an office. We accepted the offer and therefore formally entered UNESCO. With everyone's help and support in the past half a year, the Association of Master Chin Kung’s Friends at UNESCO was established and the recording studio is also in use.
<p>　　今天第一堂课，我们宗教进入联合国，这是好事，联合国对全世界宗教，肯定宗教是教育不是迷信。有不少朋友问我，宗教是教育吗？感到奇怪。我说你看看，世界上每个宗教的教主、创始人，都跟释迦牟尼佛一样讲经教学。释迦牟尼佛三十岁为我们示现开悟了，开悟之后，对于宇宙人生彻底明白了，到鹿野苑把五个同伴找回来，跟他们做报告。释迦牟尼佛讲经教学就从这里开始，传到今年三千年了。我们再细细的观察，比佛教晚一点的，有不少宗教在过去一千年前，陆陆续续传播开来。现在传教有成就的有十几个宗教，我们所熟知的。但是一定要有正确的认识，中国传统的文字，这个名词，宗教这个名词是什么意思。
<p>　　This lecture is our first today. It is a good start that religious organizations have entered UNESCO. UNESCO confirms that religions around the world are forms of education. Many friends of mine asked, 'Is religion education?' as they find the concept strange. I replied to them, 'You see, similar to Sakyamuni Buddha, the founder of every religion in the world devoted themselves in teaching.' At the age of 30, Sakyamuni Buddha attained Enlightenment and thoroughly understood everything about the universe and life. After that, he went to the Deer Park, found his five colleagues and delivered his first report. From then on, Sakyamuni Buddha started his teaching career and the Buddha's teaching has been passed down for 3,000 years. Let us take a close look at other religions. Many religions that emerged later than Buddhism were also spread gradually across the world in the past 1,000 years. Up until now, more than ten religions that we are familiar with have successfully taught generations of people. We must have a proper understanding of the word 'religion'. In Chinese language, Zong-Jiao means religion. So what does the word mean?
<p>　　中国的汉字，也是世界上独一无二的、优秀的传统文化，它不是从事拼音，它所说的每个字的含义很深。从这两个字，我们把它拆开来看，宗跟教这两个字，宗有三个意思：第一个「主要的」，第二「重要的」，第三个「尊崇的」；教也有三个意思：教育、教学、教化；宗教完全具备了这些含义。所以宗教两个字连起来，那就是：人类主要的教育，人类重要的教学，人类尊崇的教化。真的吗？你不相信，你仔细去看看。
<p>　　Chinese characters are unique in the world and they also manifest the excellent traditional culture of China. They are not alphabetic writing and each character is embedded with profound meanings. The character '宗’ (zong) has three meanings: principal, important and revered. The character '教’ (jiao) means education, teaching and transformation. Religion in fact encompasses all of these meanings. Therefore, when combined, Zong-Jiao , means principal education, important teaching, and revered transformation for humankind. Is it really the case? If you still have doubts, let us take a closer look.
<p>　　佛教在中国流传二千五百年了，确确实实，在中国传统文化，佛教占有一席之地。中国保存的典籍最丰富，称之为《大藏经》，在中国传统文化它占有相当的分量。历代这些祖师大德，跟释迦牟尼佛没有两样，终身从事于佛陀教育这个工作。每一个朝代，外国人讲世纪，现在二十一世纪，每一个世纪都有杰出的大师，出家、在家的，在家称居士，这大师级的人才可以给我们做证明。
<p>　　Buddhism has been taught in China for 2,500 years and, indeed, it has a place in traditional Chinese culture. The Chinese have preserved the richest collection of Buddhist literature called 'The Great Canon', and it has a considerable place in traditional Chinese culture. Throughout Chinese history, Buddhist patriarchs and virtuous Buddhist masters were not different from what Sakyamuni Buddha did and they had all engaged in Buddhist education in their lives. In every dynasty and every century in the history there were outstanding Buddhist masters, either ordained monks and nuns or lay Buddhists. All of these recognized masters were the evidence of religion being education.
<p>　　在今天，我们要问，既然宗教是教育，宗教教的是什么？课程教的是什么？所有宗教经典里面，诸位都能看到，它有伦理教育、它有道德教育、它有因果教育、它有智慧的教育。开悟了，大彻大悟，就是自性、真心圆满智慧起作用、出现了，在佛法里面称之为证果。
<p>　　Now, we may ask: 'Since religion is education, what does it teach? And what does its curriculum include?' In every classical Buddhist text there are ethical education, moral education, education of causality and that of wisdom. When a person is fully enlightened, it is the perfect wisdom of their True Nature at work. In Buddhism it is called attaining the fruits of Enlightenment.
<p>　　这二千五百年，佛教传到中国两千年，东汉时候传过来的，距离孔子、孟子很近，所以它也变成中国不能缺少的传统文化。谈到中国传统文化，儒释道代表了。中国儒释道都讲伦理、都讲道德、都讲因果、都讲圣学；这些圣贤们，他们开悟之后也讲经教学，留下来不少的资料。
<p>　　Buddhism was introduced to China in the Eastern Han dynasty which was about 2,000 years ago, and the time frame was closer to when Confucius and Mencius were alive. Buddhism later became an indispensable part of traditional Chinese culture. Having said traditional Chinese culture, we have to mention Confucianism, Buddhism and Daoism. All of them impart ethics, morality, causality and the teaching of sages. After attaining enlightenment, the saints and sages of the three teachings devoted themselves in education and left behind much information and wisdom.
<p>　　唐朝开国，太宗李世民找了五个汉学家，为他编了一部书，《群书治要》。这部书是什么？是中国传统文化的精华，唐太宗就靠这部书修身，就靠这部书齐家，再靠这部书治国、平天下。大唐三百年等于说实验，中国传统文化做了一次实验，真管用。那个时候管用，现在还管用，用《群书治要》来治国，我相信一定有非常好的政绩可观，可以给政治领导人做一个好榜样。
<p>　　At the beginning of the Tang dynasty, Emperor Taizong (599 CE) commissioned five best sinologists in the country to compile the book 'The Governing Principles of Ancient China' for him. What is the book about? It is a collection of the essence of traditional Chinese culture. Emperor Taizong used the book to cultivate himself, manage his family in harmony, govern his country and bring peace to the world. The 300-year history of the Tang dynasty was in fact an experiment in traditional Chinese culture, and it was really effective. It was effective then, and it is also effective today. I believe that any leader who applies the wisdom found in 'The Governing Principles' to govern their country will result in excellent governance and will also become great role model for other political leaders around the world.
<p>　　佛的文化根深，在中国，历代帝王没有不尊崇佛陀教诲，这在历史上看到了；一直到今天，古时候的寺庙还都存在，可以做见证。那么他教什么？刚才说过了，他教伦理、教道德、教因果、教他们所修学所得到的智慧。不但当代受用，流传给后世。
<p>　　Buddhist culture is deeply rooted in China. After the introduction of Buddhism, emperors of almost every dynasty respectfully followed the Buddha's teaching. Ancient Buddhist monasteries preserved in China are the witnesses of that part of history. So what did Buddhism teach? As mentioned before, Buddhists taught ethics, morality, causality and the wisdom that they had obtained from self-cultivation. What they taught was not only useful for their times, but also applicable for generations to come.
<p>　　今天这部书，有十几种不同的文字翻译本，我们相信，每个国家领导人如果都读这部书，不但能强国，能用真实智慧、历史经验，来化解现在世界上许许多多的对立、战争带来的灾难。这部书可以治国、可以平天下，平天下就是天下太平，也就是我们希望追求的，希望这个地球能走向安定和谐、共存共荣。这部书真有功德！宗教的教育跟这部书相辅相成，现在我们都找到了，大量的翻印、流通，我们来提倡、介绍给世人。
<p>　　'The Governing Principles of Ancient China' has been translated into more than ten languages. I believe, if every national leader reads this book, they will not only strengthen their country but also use true wisdom and lessons learned in history to resolve disasters caused by antagonism and wars. The book can help govern a country and bring peace to the world. World peace is what we all pursue. All of us hope for stability, harmony, mutual prosperity and coexistence. The book has its real merits! Religious education and what is taught in the book complement one another. We print and circulate the book in a great number in the hope of promoting and introducing it to people across the world.
<p>　　首先我们要身心健康。这将近两个月了，没讲经，我感觉得对同修们应该要道歉。这两个月在做什么？在调养身体，调养有一点效果。中国古人所谓的岁月不饶人，这句话是真话，不是假话。九十二岁了，身体老化，视力不如过去，过去看书不需要眼镜，现在看书离不开眼镜；耳朵要戴上助听器；写字，真的体验到了古人所谓的提笔忘字。不但我有，我还有两个老同学，徐醒民教授、江逸子教授，我们三个碰到头，深深都感到，老了！精神、体力不如过去，跟过去一年、二年相比，都有很大的差距。所以我是把讲经停了下来，把身体调整一下；还算不错，有一点效果。
<p>　　To do that, we should first of all have a healthy mind and body. I have not given Dharma talks for almost two months, and I would like to apologise to fellow practitioners. What did I do in the past two months? I recuperated for a while. It was effective. Chinese ancestors said, 'Time spares no man.' It is true indeed. I am 92 now and aging is taking its course. My vision is not as good as before. In the past I did not need glasses when reading. But now I cannot read without them. I also need to wear a hearing aid. As for writing, I can now truly experience what the ancients said 'forgetting words when about to write'. It is not just me. I have another two old classmates, Professor Xu Xingming and Professor Jiang Yizi. When we gathered together last time, all of us felt deeply that we are getting old! Our energy and strength are worse off than previous couple of years. So I stopped giving Dharma talks for a while and recuperated. Not bad, it has its effects.
<p>　　没想到联合国给我们的任务，是要我们帮助这个地球化解冲突、化解对立，希望宗教能团结、族群能团结。大家把心量拓开，能包容别人，包容不同的宗教、不同的族群，我们是一家人。因此这两个多月，我看了一些不同宗教的经典。
<p>　　Beyond my expectation, UNESCO assigned us a task of helping the world resolve conflicts and antagonism and bring cohesion to religious and ethnical groups. I hope that everyone can open up their mind, be more accommodating and accommodate different religions and ethnical groups. We are all in fact a big family. Therefore, in the past two months I revisited the sacred texts of different religions.
<p>　　《宗教３６Ｏ》将宗教主要、主修的这些经典找出来了，宗教核心的思想，也就是我们学习的中心，我们把它抓到。中心是什么？就是一个字，「爱」字。所有的宗教经典里头，没有不讲博爱、仁爱、谦爱。所以一句话全包了，「神爱世人」，这是宗教教育的中心思想。
<p>　　The book 'Scriptures 360' is a collection of the most essential teachings found in the sacred texts of different religions. Their core religious thought is the focus of our learning and we aim to grasp it. So what is the core teaching? It is one word, 'love'. In the sacred texts of all religions, there is mentioning of universal love, love of benevolence and love of humility. Therefore, the sentence 'God loves all' encompasses all of them, and this is the core thinking of religious education.
<p>　　我们要把自己的爱，自己的爱跟上帝的爱完全相同，没有丝毫分别，把它找回来，放在自己的心上。把自己的妄心、杂念抛弃掉，真心、爱心放在心上，代表上帝、代表神、代表佛菩萨、代表真主去爱世人，这就是宗教教育。它的课程就是四门，这四门我们要认真的修学，伦理的教育、道德的教育、因果的教育、圣贤智慧的教育，这是它教学的四科、它教学的内容。伦理丢掉了，不能不找回来，要想社会安定、世界和平，必须把它找回来。
<p>　　We should regain our love, which is unbiased and exactly the same as the love of God, and keep it in our hearts. We should throw away deluded minds and erroneous thinking, keep our true minds and love, and love everyone in the world on behalf of God, Buddhas and bodhisattvas. This is religious education. It has four modules, that is, ethical education, moral education, the education of causality and that of sages' wisdom. These teachings are what religious education is all about. We must learn and practise it properly. When we throw away ethics, we must find it and bring it back. If we want social stability and world peace, we must bring such teachings back.
<p>　　中国古圣先贤对于教育非常重视，教的内容也就是这四样。所以佛陀教育传到中国来，中国人立刻能够接受，为什么？跟中国古圣先贤所说的非常接近，无二无别。现在这个时代，科学技术发达，这四种教育都没有了。科学这里面还接近智慧，但是因果、道德、伦理没有了。所以今天，富贵，富而不乐；贵，地位虽然很高，社会大众没有看在眼里。所以变成什么第一？金钱第一。社会怎么会不乱？
<p>　　Chinese ancestors had always attached great importance to education, which also included the four areas mentioned before. Therefore, when Buddhist education was introduced to China, the Chinese easily accepted it. Why? What it teaches is very close to traditional Chinese education. In this era, science and technology are highly developed, but the four areas of education are missing. Science is relatively closer to wisdom, but causality, morality and ethics are missing. It is why in today's world the rich are not happy and those of high social status are not respected. What is considered as the most Important thing? Money. Under this circumstance, how can society stay away from chaos?
<p>　　所以我们想不辜负联合国对我们的一番情义，对整个世界的宗教这番情义，给我们设立了办公室，我们非常感谢。我们要把神圣的宗教教育找回来，认真学习；先学习自己的宗教，然后再学其他的宗教，求同存异。终极的目标，希望世界永远不再有冲突、不再有对立、不再有误会，希望这个地球上真正的仁爱、和平能够实现。Therefore, we do not want to disappoint UNESCO's affection and friendship for us and for religions in the world. We are most grateful that UNESCO offered us an office. We hope to bring back sacred religious education, and learn and practise it properly. We will first learn and practise our own religion and then learn from other religions in the hope of seeking common grounds and putting aside differences. Our ultimate goal is that there will never be conflicts, antagonism and misunderstanding in the world, and that true love of benevolence and peace will be realised on Earth.
<p>　　所以我们第一堂课跟大家说的，认识宗教的真义。今天时间到了，我们就学习到此地，谢谢大家。
<p>　　So in this first lecture I shared with you, the understanding of the true meaning of word religion". This is it for today and thank you.　　</html>
