With this interconnected relationship, everyone in the society forms a complex and inseparable relationship network. Like the system in an individual living being, the closer the cooperative relationships that the cells form, the healthier and more vigorous the living being will be. A plant is healthy and lush because every cell in its roots, stems, branches, and leaves work selflessly and tirelessly for the survival and development of the whole. In the final analysis, the power that connects these countless cells is a ‘one body’ relationship.",

If cells or organs of a living being are unwilling to take care of each other, unwilling to work for or have conflicts with each other, the life force of this living being will end quickly.

From this, we can conclude that if people drift apart and become indifferent, even to the point of becoming suspicious and competitive, the social symbiosis will easily lose vitality and become sick.",

The mother-child relationship shows the most powerful connection between people. In this relationship, there is no indifference, suspicion or selfishness. It only consists of an unconditional, selfless love and unconditional trust. We can see that, if a mother doesn’t have altruistic love for her child or if a child doesn’t have unreserved trust in the mother, human life would not continue for long. We can assume that, for the continuity and development of life, there is no other biological power that is stronger than that of mother-child relationship. The essence of this unparalleled power is love and trust. Unconditional love and absolute trust.",

The distinguished British historian and philosopher, Dr Toynbee once reminded us that a loss of harmony in a society will inevitably lead to that society losing its ability to survive. Dr Toynbee found that, throughout history, on the eve of the collapse of every civilization, all levels of society within the civilization will be in a state of division. Dr Toynbee told us that the root cause of the decline of a civilization and the ultimate standard for its decline is actually the loss of harmony within this society.",

Competition is a sign of fighting to get ahead; conflict precedes destruction. Understanding this, we must remain vigilant. We just talked about a mother’s love for her child and a child’s unconditional trust in the mother. Actually, trust originates from a love that does not differentiate and the ‘oneness’ relationship between a mother and her child. Therefore, we can say that love is the strongest connection between people. Love guides us back to the original oneness relationship of life and to the purest trust between people.",
