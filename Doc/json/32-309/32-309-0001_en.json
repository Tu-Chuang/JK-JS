Jiao means to follow, or to be an example for others to follow. Yu means to raise children so that they can act with good intent. So, by combining the two characters into one word, we have the meaning of education—to act and speak as examples to teach our children properly so that their innate goodness will be inspired. This meaning of education is similar to what is found in the Bible: ‘Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.’ (Proverbs 22:6 KJV)",

Once, when visiting Beijing Normal University, I saw a motto written and agreed upon by all the professors of the school. The motto is ‘Learn to be an excellent teacher; act as an exemplary model for all’. To me, it encapsulates the essence of the great Buddhist Avatamsaka Sutra, which perfectly includes all forms of secular and spiritual education.",

They transformed peoples’ lives by practicing everything they had taught. When people are willing to trust and follow the teachings, such education will be successful.",

If we could summarize everything into one phrase, it would be  ‘filial piety’. Filial piety is represented by the Chinese character 孝 (xiao). The upper character 老represents the word ‘elders’. The lower character 子 refers to ‘children’. By combining ‘elders’ and ‘children’ into one character, the oneness between parents and their children is shown to be inseparable. Parents have their parents and children also have their children. This lineage has no clear beginning and will continue indefinitely. In a sense, infinite space and time are one. This is the truth of the universe. How can we fail to love others and live in harmony with others if we are all one living entity?  When we are one, how can there be competition or conflict?",

Dr Elisabet Sahtouris once said, ‘If bacteria could learn to cooperate without the benefit of a heart or brain, surely we humans should be able to so as well’. With her research, Dr Sahtouris reminds us that humankind must find the ‘oneness’ together. And with the universal love found in the oneness of humankind, this universal love will help our world return to its sacredness. The most profound meaning of the universe is elegantly simple.",
