Many friends of mine asked, 'Is religion education?' as they find the concept strange. I replied to them, 'You see, similar to Sakyamuni Buddha, the founder of every religion in the world devoted themselves in teaching.' At the age of 30, Sakyamuni Buddha attained Enlightenment and thoroughly understood everything about the universe and life. After that, he went to the Deer Park, found his five colleagues and delivered his first report. From then on, Sakyamuni Buddha started his teaching career and the Buddha's teaching has been passed down for 3,000 years. Let us take a close look at other religions. Many religions that emerged later than Buddhism were also spread gradually across the world in the past 1,000 years. Up until now, more than ten religions that we are familiar with have successfully taught generations of people. We must have a proper understanding of the word 'religion'. In Chinese language, Zong-Jiao means religion. So what does the word mean?",
