If my mind did not settle down, I would not take in his words and I would not have believed what my teacher said. That half an hour was much like entering into meditation for me. After that, my mind was pure without any thought. He then said one word, ‘Yes.’ Well, hearing his answer, I immediately focused my attention to what he was about to say. Wrong move! Because wandering thoughts arised in my mind. Once again, he stopped speaking. This time, he waited for about 10 minutes. You see, in the first 30 minutes, I settled down my mind and he said one word ‘yes’. After that, my mind was stirred and random thoughts together with differentiation and attachment was present. As I had all of those, he did not speak further. Ten minutes later, my mind settled down again. He then told me, “See through and let go”. “See through the truth of everything will help you let go of them. Letting go of things helps you see through them.” Then, I understood the method. What is the cultivation and practice of Buddhism? It is to see through things and let go of them. Seeing through things is wisdom, and letting go of them is real practise.",
      "zh_TW": "Learn to “let go” is how you should cultivate yourself. I sought guidance from my teacher, the Changkya Khutukhtu, ‘Is there a quicker way of getting into Buddhism?’ Having heard my question, he looked at me.  And I looked at him back. We looked at one another in silence for half an hour. I did not know what he meant by looking at me at that time. Later, I realised that he was waiting for my mind to settle down.

There are just too many benefits from such practice. Gradually, you will attain the state of the minds of Buddhas. Buddhas and bodhisattvas have attained enlightenment. You will also attain it. Enlightenment is something innate to our self-nature, and it is not gained from outside. The ability to practise is also innate to us and it is also meditative concentration. When there is something on our minds, we cannot enter into meditative concentrate. So when we let go of wandering thoughts, differentiation and attachment, our minds will be able to achieve meditative concentration. Meditative concentration gives rise to wisdom, which is innate in our self-nature. Subsequently, we shall be able to delve deeper into the sutras and gradually grasp the width and depth of them. This is something we must know. I hope that fellow students can slowly contemplate it.",
