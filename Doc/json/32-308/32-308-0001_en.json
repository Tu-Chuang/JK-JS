We do miss his candid and kind words, as well as his extensive and mastery knowledge. His departure has been a great loss to us. Fortunately, we have younger generation successors who can shoulder his responsibilities and continue to lead the academy in the hope to accomplish Clayton’s unfinished mission.",
